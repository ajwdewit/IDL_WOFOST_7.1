# IDL_WOFOST_7.1
This repository holds an IDL version of the WOFOST 7.1 crop simulation model.

The IDL implementation of the model was created by Chen zhiqiang (chengzq@radi.ac.cn), Meng Jihua (mengjh@radi.ac.cn) and Wang Yiming (wangym92@outlook.com) of the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The code was kindly provided by them to be hosted on my code repository and to be distributed under an open license.

A use case for the model is described in the following paper: http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/4/303

As WageningenUR we cannot provide support for this WOFOST implementation. Please contact the original authors in case you run in to problems.
